## Project Overview

This project aims to explore the impact, possibilities, and risks associated with the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the Hotel management program at Breda University of Applied Sciences (BUas). By employing both quantitative and qualitative research methods, the study seeks to understand the attitudes, knowledge, acceptance, and perceived impact of AI among students, staff, and the organization as a whole. The results will be used to guide stakeholders in making informed decisions regarding the adoption and implementation of AI technologies at BUas.

## Objectives

- To investigate the attitudes, knowledge, and acceptance of AI among BUas students, staff, and other stakeholders.
- To assess the perceived impact of AI on the educational environment, including both opportunities and risks.
- To provide data-driven recommendations for AI policy and implementation at BUas.
- To disseminate research findings through various formats, including a research paper, policy paper, and conference poster presentation.

## Project Scope

The project will focus on the following key areas:

1. **Attitudes Towards AI**: Understanding how students and staff feel about the integration of AI in the education of Hotel management students.
2. **Knowledge of AI**: Assessing the level of knowledge and awareness regarding AI among BUas stakeholders.
3. **Acceptance of AI**: Exploring the willingness of stakeholders to adopt AI technologies in their educational or professional activities.
4. **Perceived Impact of AI**: Identifying the perceived risks and opportunities associated with AI implementation.

## Methodology

### Quantitative Research

- **Survey Design**: A comprehensive survey will be designed to gather quantitative data from a broad sample of BUas students, staff, and other stakeholders. 
- **Data Collection**: The survey will be distributed across BUas domains to capture a diverse range of responses.
- **Data Analysis**: Statistical methods will be used to analyze the survey data, identifying key trends and correlations.

### Qualitative Research

- **Interviews**: In-depth interviews will be conducted with a select group of stakeholders to gain deeper insights into their perspectives on AI.
- **Thematic Analysis**: The qualitative data from interviews will be analyzed using thematic analysis to identify common themes and patterns.

## Deliverables

1. **Research Paper**: A comprehensive report detailing the findings of the mixed-method study, including both quantitative and qualitative analysis.
2. **Policy Paper**: A concise document that summarizes the key findings and provides actionable recommendations for AI policy at BUas.
3. **Conference Poster**: A visual representation of the research findings, suitable for presentation at academic and professional conferences.
